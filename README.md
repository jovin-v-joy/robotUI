  - The UI accepts X Y and Facing position as inputs then 'Place' the Robot ( Initialise the Robot)
  - There are 4 button controlls which can use to move the robot and change facing position and REPORT to Get latest move.
  - there is a basic graphic representation of Robot which moves the robot based on user action.
  - Also there is a panel which shows current position and if there is any error during the move.
